This is a basic calculator application built using Python's Tkinter GUI library. It supports essential arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with parentheses for grouped expressions. The calculator features a clear (C) button to reset input and an equals (=) button to evaluate the entered expression. The interface is structured using the grid() layout manager to ensure a clean, evenly spaced design. Input is handled through button widgets, and the current expression or result is displayed using a multi-line Text widget. The application includes a responsive layout, minimal styling, and proper error handling for invalid expressions. It is developed using Python 3 and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.
